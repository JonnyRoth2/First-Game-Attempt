# First-Game-Attempt
I am going to attempt to make a game in C++ and C#
This is the repository to hold all of the base code and that will be the way to run the games but the actual base files of sprites wont be uploaded here just yet
much code inspired from youtube such as bblakeyyy, Pandemonium and others.
