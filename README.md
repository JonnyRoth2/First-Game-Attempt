# First-Game-Attempt
I am going to attempt to make a game in C++ and C#
This is the repository to hold all of the base code and that will be the way to run the games but the actual base files of sprites wont be uploaded here just yet.
alot of the code is inspired from youtube such as bblakeyyy, Pandemonium and others and really is just for my own reuse in other projects but is good code for others who don know much about C#/C++.
